# park-visitation
The repository contains code to analyze the weather data and find insights that could help predict visitation patterns at a park.
Machine learning workflow has been followed to train and fine-tune regression models.
The steps are data collection and exploration, data processing, feature correlations, automating processing by pipelines, building models,
evaluating performance by cross-validation, fine-tuning, and predicting the number of visitors at a park using unseen weather data.
